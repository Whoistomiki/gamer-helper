*Management games, from the management of a factory to that of a royal dynasty, passing by a football team or an F1 team.*
*What do all of these (retro) games have in common?*
*Taking notes, lots of notes, to optimize and organize your game.*
*The idea is to create an application that brings together tools to facilitate note taking and optimization.*

### Built with

<p> In this section, we mainly used React, Zustand, Axios, HMTL, SCSS for the front end.</p>

<p>
And for the back-end part we used Postgres, Sequelize, Sqitch, Express, Bcrypt, Totp Generator, Nodemailer.

### Getting started

#### Installation

1. Clone the files :
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:O-clock-Icare/projet-03-gamer-heleper-front.git + git@github.com:O-clock-Icare/projet-03-gamer-heleper-back.git(for the ssh format)
   or 
   git clone https://github.com/O-clock-Icare/projet-03-gamer-heleper-front.git + https://github.com/O-clock-Icare/projet-03-gamer-heleper-back.git(for the https format)
   ```
2. Install NPM packages for both files :
   ```sh
   npm install or npm install --force
   ```
3. Creation of your database in the back file :
   ```sh
   sudo -i -u postgres psql / Connecting to the database
   CREATE USER gamerhelper PASSWORD 'gamerhelper'; / Creating an user with password
   CREATE DATABASE gamerhelper OWNER 'gamerhelper'; / Creating a database
   ```
4. Rename the files .env.example and sqitch.example.conf with your user and database logs :
   ```sh
   in the sqitch.conf file for example
   target = db:pg://gamehelper:gamehelper@localhost:5432/gamerhelper 
   
   in the .env file
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://gamerhelper:gamerhelper@localhost:5432/gamerhelper
   SECRET_KEY=vDgBt.1@WjN2sT-iT7+I$:MJyb&!
   KEY_OTP=JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP
   ```
5. Use Sqitch :
   ```sh
   sqitch deploy

   The message displayed on your screen should be
   + init .......... ok
